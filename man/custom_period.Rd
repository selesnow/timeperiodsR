\description{
Create tpr object between start and end dates
}
\usage{
custom_period(start, 
              end,
              part = c("all", "start", "end", 
			           "sequence", "length"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{start}{Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format}
  \item{end}{End date in YYYY-MM-DD format}
  \item{part}{Part of period you need to receive, one of "all", "start", "end","sequence", "length". See details.}
}
\details{

\itemize{
  \item all - get all components
  \item start - get only first date of period
  \item end - get only last date of period

## To create tpr object between two dates
customper <- custom_period(start = "2019-09-01",
                           end   = "2019-09-05")

## To get vector of date sequences 
seq(customper)

## Get number of days of previous months
length(customper)

## To get start of end dates
start(customper)
end(customper)
